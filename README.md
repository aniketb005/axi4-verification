## AXI4 Verification IP in System Verilog Using UVM Methodology

This project was completed in 2019 using QuestaSim and Riviera Aldec Pro(for Assertions)

This is a configurable UVM based verification IP. It verifies the AXI protocol and generates the required functional coverage.

1. Developed an environment with single master agent and slave agent
which can be configured later.
2. Verified Master and Slave's Universal Verification Component(UVC) functionality with different types of transfers and bursts.
3. Generated functional coverage for verification sign-off.
